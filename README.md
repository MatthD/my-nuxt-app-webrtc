# Webrtc minimal webserver

Make sure to install the dependencies:

````bash
# npm
npm install

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

Then go to http://localhost:3000/webrtc  (it will start api and compile front)

Due to some issue if you change code on back it will crash the server, just restart the command!
